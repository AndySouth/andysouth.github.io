In this first post of this new blog I'll outline how I've set it up.
 
I wanted to be able to write about R related things without having to copy and paste code, figures or files.
 
 
 
Using the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) from GitHub.
 
Editing and commiting from RStudio.
 

```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```
 
You can also embed plots, for example:
 
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](/figures/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)
