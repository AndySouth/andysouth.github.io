In this first post of this new blog I'll outline how I've set it up.

I wanted to be able to write about R related things without having to copy and paste code, figures or files.



Using the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) from GitHub.

Editing and commiting from RStudio.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
